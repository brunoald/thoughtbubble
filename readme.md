# [Reflex](http://reflex.doublethink.is)

Reflex is a front-end development framework written in HTML5, JavaScript and Sass. It is designed to serve as a starting point for modern web projects. Reflex does not attempt to dictate the style of the site with presets, only to combine sensible defaults with robust grid building tools
